# Traffic-Accident-Clustering-with-Spectral-Clustering
This repository contains a Python implementation of a system for clustering traffic accidents using spectral clustering. The system is based on the 2021 traffic accident dataset, which is a publicly available dataset of traffic accidents in the United States.
The system is implemented using the following Python libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and, Sklearn.
The system first cleans the data and removes any null values. It then performs principal component analysis (PCA) on the data to reduce the dimensionality of the data. Finally, the system uses spectral clustering to cluster the accidents into groups based on their similarities.
The system can be used to #Cluster traffic accidents, #Visualize the clusters of accidents, #Identify the factors that contribute to traffic accidents
The system is still under development, but it is already able to cluster traffic accidents with a high degree of accuracy. I plan to add more features to the system, such as the ability to predict future traffic accidents.
I hope you find this system useful!
